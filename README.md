## what it is

AI agent that automates due diligence right from your email— for busy investors.

**problems:**

— Investors get tons of emails, and decks daily in their inbox— some are irrelevant some might be the one they are looking for and its time consuming to manually triage all of them.

— Analysts open multiple tabs, links of founders and figure out if the the founder is a fit or to match with their thesis.

— Analysts spends almost one week to analyse all the data points, get probabilities metrics, prepare a memo.

**how diligenceAI works:**

— It triage out all irrelevant emails and automatically analyse the material of the email and attachments  — cross checks with with your thesis  and sends you slack notification.

facts: 

> Venture capitalists (VCs) spend an average of 20% of their workday dealing with emails, equating to roughly 1.5 to 2 hours daily.
— Automating the triage and analysis process can reduce the time spent on initial screening by up to 50%.
— Better organisation and prioritisation of emails can lead to a 25% increase in the speed of investment decisions.
